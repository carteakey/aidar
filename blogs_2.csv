Scott Preston's piece in Barron's from February 2020: https://www.barrons.com/articles/game...

The Roaring Kitty channel revolves around educational live streams where I share my daily routine of tracking stocks and performing investment research.

My investment style involves continually tracking thousands of stocks using a variety of widely available tools. When opportunity strikes – as it occasionally does in markets comprised of biased humans – I’m prepared to pounce and capitalize on the situation. I'm probably best classified as a fundamentals-focused deep value investor, though I find I'm increasingly leaning on technical analysis for screening, timing, and tracking stocks. In the years ahead I look forward to honing my portfolio management approach by acquiring bolt-on skillsets and further developing my approach to risk management.

Some of the tools I use: Google Chrome, Chrome extensions & search engines, Google Sheets / Google Apps Script / StackOverflow, StockCharts, insider buying via OpenInsider, stock ownership via WhaleWisdom, SEC filings via sec.gov, SeekingAlpha, Twitter, Quandl / Sharadar, and bond prices via FINRA. 

The Roaring Kitty channel and live streams are for educational purposes only. I share my approach to investing in an effort to set you on the right path to building out your own investment process. I don't provide personal investment advice or stock recommendations during the stream. Please understand that my style of investing is extremely aggressive and I take on a substantial amount of risk. It's likely my approach would not be suitable for you. If you're seeking personalized advice, I encourage you to sit down with a financial professional who can review your personal situation, financial background, risk tolerance, etc. Check out the Roaring Kitty disclaimer video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM-Us...",https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&si=6AOk3GkhBN2QyB2D&v=alntJzg0Um4,,2024-12-29T01:55:31.204Z,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/alntJzg0Um4/maxresdefault.jpg,,false

Watch: MIT’s Deep Learning State of the Art lecture referencing this post

Featured in courses at Stanford, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, CMU and others

In the previous post, we looked at Attention – a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.

The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic:
