# Global category weights for aggregate scoring.
# All weights must sum to 1.0.
# Edit these to tune the scoring formula.

weights:
  phrases: 0.40       # Hedging language, AI idioms — strongest signal
  punctuation: 0.20   # Em dashes, ellipsis overuse
  structure: 0.15     # Bullet density, header frequency (reduced — QA was dominating)
  vocabulary: 0.15    # Formal register, rare word density
  emoji: 0.10         # Emoji frequency and placement

# Score thresholds for human-readable labels.
# Calibrated against real scan data: pure-human blogs score 0-7,
# AI-assisted content scores 10-22, heavy AI usage scores 25+.
# These are intentionally conservative — use corpus percentile for
# relative comparison once you have enough scan data.
thresholds:
  likely_human_max: 15   # 0-15  → LIKELY HUMAN
  likely_ai_min: 30      # 30+   → LIKELY AI
                         # 16-29 → UNCERTAIN
