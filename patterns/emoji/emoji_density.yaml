name: Emoji Density
description: >
  Some AI models (particularly GPT-4 in certain system prompt configurations)
  sprinkle emojis liberally throughout text. This is uncommon in formal or
  editorial human writing. High emoji density is a moderate signal; its
  absence in otherwise AI-patterned text is also informative for model
  identification (Claude rarely uses emoji).
