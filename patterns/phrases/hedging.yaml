description: >
  LLMs systematically hedge assertions with qualifiers like "it's worth noting",
  "it's important to", "certainly", "absolutely", and "of course" at much higher
  density than human writing. These phrases function as politeness scaffolding
  baked into RLHF training, making the model appear cautious and helpful.
