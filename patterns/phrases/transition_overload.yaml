name: Transition Word Overload
description: >
  AI models use paragraph-linking transition words ("furthermore", "moreover",
  "additionally", "however", "nevertheless", "consequently") at much higher

  formulaic essay structure. Different from formal_register in that it focuses
  specifically on connective transitions rather than generally formal vocabulary.
