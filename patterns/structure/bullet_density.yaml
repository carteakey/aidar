description: >
  AI-generated content defaults to bullet lists to simulate "organized" writing
  regardless of whether the content warrants it. Human long-form prose rarely
  exceeds 10-15% bullet-listed lines; AI output frequently reaches 30-60%.
  Measured as the ratio of lines beginning with common bullet markers to total
  non-empty lines.
