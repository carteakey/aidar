name: Paragraph Length Uniformity
description: >
  Human writers vary paragraph length naturally. AI output tends to produce
  paragraphs of suspiciously uniform length. Measured as the coefficient of
  variation (std_dev / mean) of paragraph word counts — lower values indicate
  more robotic uniformity. Inverted: lower CV = higher AI signal.
