description: >
  Human writers ask questions — rhetorical, direct, conversational. AI-generated
  text almost never asks questions; it answers them. Near-zero question rates in
  long-form text are a meaningful signal. Measured as fraction of sentences
  ending with '?', inverted: low question rate → high score.
  Note: technical/instructional content naturally has fewer questions — weight
  this lower for documentation-style content.
