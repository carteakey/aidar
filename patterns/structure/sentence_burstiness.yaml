name: Low Sentence Length Burstiness
version: 1
description: >
  Humans naturally mix short punchy sentences with long winding ones. AI models
  output sentences of suspiciously uniform length — medium-length, clean
  subject-verb-object constructions with little variation. Measured as the
  coefficient of variation (std_dev / mean) of sentence word counts, inverted:
  low CV (uniform) → high score.
