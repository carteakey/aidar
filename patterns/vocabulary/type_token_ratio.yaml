version: 1
description: >
  Standardized Type-Token Ratio measures lexical diversity: unique words / total
  words across sliding 50-word windows. AI models reuse vocabulary more than
  humans — particularly restating the same concepts with slight rephrasing.
  A lightweight proxy for "perplexity" without requiring a language model.
  Score is inverted: low STTR (repetitive) → high score.
